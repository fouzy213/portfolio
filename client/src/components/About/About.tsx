          Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Fouzy Chikouche. I am
          currently undergoing a career change and passionately training to
          become a full stack web developer. After working with React and
          Node.js, I am now specializing in Java and Angular development to
          strengthen both my frontend and backend skills in a professional
          environment. Before transitioning into tech, I worked as a
          self-employed fiber optic technician, mainly for SFR. This experience
          taught me discipline, independence, and a strong sense of service
          qualities I now apply to my development projects. Iâ€™m curious,
          determined, and constantly evolving. Iâ€™m currently looking for an
          apprenticeship or a position where I can continue learning, contribute
          to real-world projects, and grow within a development team. Thank you
          for visiting, and feel free to{" "}
